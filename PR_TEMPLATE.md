### Related Issue

**Issue:** Fixes integration test failures caused by circular dependency in SharedUriHandler

### Description

Resolves `TypeError: Class extends value undefined` error in integration tests by fixing a circular dependency between `SharedUriHandler` and `WebviewProvider`.

- Convert WebviewProvider import to type-only import
- Update handleUri method to accept webviewProvider parameter  
- This resolves integration test failures caused by class extending undefined at runtime

### Test Procedure

- Ran `npm test` - all 62 unit tests and integration tests now pass (previously integration tests were failing)
- Verified the circular dependency is resolved by using type-only imports and dependency injection pattern
- Confirmed existing functionality remains intact - no changes to user-facing behavior
- Integration tests that were previously failing due to class extension errors now complete successfully

### Type of Change

-   [x] üêõ Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)

### Pre-flight Checklist

-   [x] Changes are limited to a single feature, bugfix or chore (split larger changes into separate PRs)
